Summa lets centralized exchanges (CEXes) generate proof of solvency while keeping their sensitive data private. Proof of Solvency means that the assets under the control of the CEX are greater than its liabilities.

$Assets \geq  Liabilities$

Or, in simpler terms, the CEX has the assets to cover all the balances of its users so that they can withdraw their funds at any time.
